Once you input a word, look at the Topic Cloud on the right, and we'll display a bunch of related tags for you to add into your search.\nLarge words are attached to more influencer profiles, and darker words are more closely related to your original topic.",

Utilize the Topic Cloud to help you explore new combinations. Make sure to set your filters properly as well:\n\na. Audience Geo > 5% in a market you are trying to sell in. We recommend setting it this low because for countries other than the U.S., the number of users on the platforms is relatively small, so filtering for influencers with audiences primarily > 10% or above in these countries will return relatively few results. b. Recent posts less than 30 days mean your influencer is active and posts regularly!\n\nc. Engagement rate is important but don't set it too high. >1% is the highest we recommend, but we've had great success with influencers with lower engagement rates as well.",
